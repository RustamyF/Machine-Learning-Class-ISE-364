# Project Discription
The purpose of this project is to find a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit and identify the important factors that influence the clients’ decisions. Data visualization is performed to clean the data and evaluate the weight (influence) of each feature on the outcome of the customer’s decision. The imbalance in the provided data is treated by resampling techniques before building the classification models. Five machine learning models (i.e Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks by Keras) have been used to determine the best model that give the best prediction. The optimal model with highest prediction accuracy of 89 % was found to be the Neural Networks algorithm.
